;;; pianobar.el --- Run Pandora as an inferior process in emacs by using pianobar

;;; Keywords: pianobar

;;; Piano bar is a console based pandora client. It works pretty well
;;; out of the box with Emacs except that the command intiators (e.g. "p"
;;; for pause) do not work without sending the string directly to the process
;;; with (comint-send-string )

;;; Right now pianobar expects a lot of the interaction to be from
;;; the pianobar inferior process.

;; INSTALLATION
;; ================

;; Installation instructions:
;;
;; 1. Put this file in your emacs load path OR add the following to
;;    your .emacs file (modifying the path appropriately):
;;
;;    (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/pianobar.el")
;;
;; 2. Add the following to your .emacs file to load this file
;;    automatically when M-x pianobar is run:
;;
;;    (autoload 'pianobar "pianobar" nil t)

A pianobar process can be fired up with M-x pianobar.

Since pianobar can no read direct input from the buffer to issue a command
you must first press the \\{pianobar-key} (usually f7) and then press one
of the following commands:
+    love current song
-    ban current song
a    add music to current station
c    create new station
d    delete current station
e    explain why this song is played
g    add genre station

j    add shared station

r    rename current station
s    change station
t    tired (ban song for 1 month)
u    upcoming songs
x    select quickmix stations
b    bookmark song/artist

When pianobar is expecting you to type something normal comint input will work.

Customization: Entry to this mode runs the hooks on comint-mode-hook and
 pianobar-mode-hook (in that order).

You can send text to the inferior pianobar process from othber buffers containing
pianobar source.
    switch-to-pianobar switches the current buffer to the pianobar process buffer.
    pianobar-send-region sends the current region to the pianobar process.
