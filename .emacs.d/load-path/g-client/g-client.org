* An Emacs Interface To Google Services

Google offers a number of services using  a Google
account. Many of these services also expose a Web API. this
package provides a set of Emacs modules for accessing these
services from inside Emacs. These modules are designed with an
Emacs-centric, rather than a Web-browser centered view of the
world. Where necessary Emacs package =browse-url= is used to
invoke the Web browser of choice.

Note that this is still  work in progress. I'm releasing it as
part of the Emacspeak project since I believe the package already
has sufficiently useful functionality for users who spend a large
amount of their time inside Emacs. There is no dependency on
Emacspeak, and all clients provided here can be used
without Emacspeak loaded.

** Installation

These are needed only if installing package =g-client=
stand-alone, i.e. outside of Emacspeak.

  - Unpack the tar archive and place the resulting =g-client=
    directory on your emacs =load-path=.
  - Type =make= to compile the code.
  - In your .emacs, add =(load-library "g")= to set it up.

** How It Works

Clients are implemented using Google APIs based on Atom
Publishing Protocol [[http://bitworking.org/projects/atom/draft-ietf-atompub-protocol-09.html][APP]] and Google Data APIs ([[http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/index.html][GData]]). We use =curl=
to retrieve content via /HTTPS/ and =xsltproc= to transform the
retrieved content to browsable HTML.

Clients sign you in the first time you invoke commands that require
authentication. Once signed in, the session cookie is cached for future
use. Session cookies presently expire in 30 minutes, and clients check for
expired cookies when authentication is needed. If the cookie has expired,
clients retrieve a fresh cookie using the authentication credentials provided
earlier. Note that authorization tokens etc are specific to a
given service.

** Top-level Customizations

All clients in this package use Emacs' =customize= interface to
set user preferences.
The most commonly used  ones are enumerated below.

  - =g-user-email= Default email-id to use. Individual clients
    typically override this via user option
    =<clientname>-user-email=.
  - =g-html-handler= Name of function that handles HTML content.

** Google Blogger /gblogger/

This client implements posting, editting and deleting of blog
entries using the new Blogger API --- it replaces the now
obsolete [[http://emacsgeek.blogspot.com/2006/01/announcing-atom-blogger.html][atom-blogger]] that implemented similar functionality
using the old Blogger API. It uses value of customization option
=g-user-email= by default; this can be overridden via option
=gblogger-user-email=. See [[http://code.google.com/apis/blogger/overview.html][Blogger GData API]] for the underlying
APIs used. For editing posts, I recommend installing [[http://www.thaiopensource.com/nxml-mode/][nxml-mode]].

  - /Browse/ Command =gblogger-blog= brings up the list of blogs
    owned by the currently authenticated user.
  - /Posting/ Command =gblogger-new-entry= takes a *post URL* and sets
    up a special buffer where you can compose your
    article. the *post url* is obtained from the feed of blogs
    above, use the *post* link for the blog to which you wish to
    post.
  - /Browsing/      Command =gblogger-atom-display= displays the
    atom feed for a specified blog as a browsable HTML page. In
    addition to reading your blog, this helps you find the *edit
    url* for individual posts.
  - /Editting/ Command =gblogger-edit-entry= takes the *edit url*
    of a previously posted entry. It retrieves the entry, and
    sets up a special composition buffer where you can edit the entry.
  - /Submitting/ The special composition buffer created by
    commands =gblogger-new-entry= and =gblogger-edit-entry=
    provide a special command =gblogger-publish= (bound to =C-c
    C-c=) that submits the entry to blogger.
  - /Deleting/ Command =gblogger-delete-entry= deletes an entry
    specified by its *edit url*.

** Google Calendar /gcal/

This client can be used to view, add or delete events from the
Google Calendar for the authenticated user. It uses value of
customization option =g-user-email= by default; this can be
overridden via option =gcal-user-email=. Commands that display
calendar items optionally accept the feed url of the calendar to
view; this can be used to view calendars to which the
authenticated user has read access. See [[http://code.google.com/apis/calendar/overview.html][GData Calendar API]] for
the underlying APIs used.

  - /View/ Command =gcal-calendar-agenda= displays the default
    calendar for the authenticated user. A prefix arg prompts for
    the calendar to display. This command is best used from
    inside the Emacs calendar; in this case, it uses the date
    under point when showing the agenda.
  - /Add/ Command =gcal-add-event= prompts for event details and
    adds it to the calendar.
  - /Accept/ Command =gcal-accept-event= accepts an event. Event
    is specified using the *edit url* of the event.
  - /Delete/ Command =gcal-delete-event= deletes an event. Event
    is specified using the *edit url* of the event.

** Google Reader /greader/

This client allows the authenticated user to read, browse and
subscribe/unsubscribe to feeds.
It uses value of customization option =g-user-email= by
default; this can be overridden via option =g-user-email=.

  - /Reading/ Command =greader-reading-list= displays the
    reading list (river of news).
  - /Browsing/ Command =greader-feed-list= displays a
    browsable Web page with pointers to  subscribed feeds.
  - /Finding/ Command =greader-find-feeds= searches for matching
    feeds to subscribe.
  - /Subscribing/ Commands =greader-subscribe-feed= and
    =greader-unsubscribe-feed= are used to subscribe and
    unsubscribe.
  - /Labeling/ Command =greader-star= and =greader-add-label= are
    used to label articles.
  - /Reading/ Starred  articles can be read by
    providing a prefix argument to command
    =greader-reading-list=. Thus, C-u M-x greader-reading-list
    will prompt for the specific set of articles to retrieve.
